                            Copyright Infringement Counter-Notification <br />
                            When we receive a Copyright Infringement claiming that Work(s) provided to us by an artist
                            infringe copyright of others, we may remove the allegedly infringing Work(s) immediately,
                            without contacting or notifying the artist in advance.
                            If we removed Work(s) provided by the artist, following a Copyright Infringement Notification,
                            the artist will receive a message from us, detailing the name and email of the party who filed
                            the notification and/ or additional details contained in the notification.
                            If the artist believes that the notification received is an error, or that he is authorized to
                            provide the Work(s) to us, he may submit a counter-notification.
                            Instructions on how to submit a counter-notification will be provided in the message we sent to
                            the artist.
                            Before filing a counter-notification, please note:
                            ● Only the artist who provided the Work(s) or its authorized representative may file a
                            counter-notification.
                            ● A counter-notification should be submitted only if the Work(s) was removed due to a mistake or
                            misidentification.
                            After receiving a valid counter-notification, we will forward it to the party who filed the
                            Copyright Infringement Notification.
                            If we do not receive a notice from the party who filed the Copyright Infringement Notification,
                            that they have filed an action with the court to keep the Work(s) down, according to the DMCA or
                            relevant laws in other countries, we will restore or cease to disable access to the Work(s) that
                            were removed.
                            Note: This section is intended to comply with the relevant provisions of the DMCA and other
